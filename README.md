# Aloria

Your automated personal assistant powered by AI and web3.

## How it uses AI

Multiple LLMs working together control a web browser to execute tasks like booking flight tickets or signing up for events.

## How it uses web3/crypto

Users submit small bounties with their requests. These bounties get paid to the "miners" who run nodes which execute the tasks by providing compute power for the headless web browsers and AI models.
